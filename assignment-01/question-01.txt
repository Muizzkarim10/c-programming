Syntax are the rules that define the structure and format of code, like spelling, punctuation, and the correct order of elements. It is the grammar of a programming language. Syntax error prevent the program from running, they can be solved easily.

Semantics is the meaning or the logic behind the code. Error in the logic of code is hard to find because the program runs but gives wrong output.

Examples:
1. mean =  a + b / 2;

2. if ( x = 4 ) {
	printf("%d", x);
}
