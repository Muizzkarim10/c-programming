-defined global variables and Initialized required global arrays and variables.
-Initialized a character Array "letters" with the required letters.
-Added function prototypes.

Functions
1. resetBoard()
-fill the board with #

2. printBoard()
-used a for loop to print the board on terminal.

3. shuffleLetters()
-Randomly shuffles the letters Array everytime the code is run.
-than the letters are filled in the cards Array.

4. checkPairs()
-checks if the revealed cards are pairs or not.
-it takes rows, cols, turn as parameters
-than saves the first coordinates in last_row, last_col
-than after the it recieves the coordinates of second card it compares them to check if they are pair using a if else statnment.
-after getting both coordinates first it checks if a revealed card is a joker or not, if it is a joker than it removes the joker and the other card pair from the game.
-if not a joker than it continues to check if the cards are pairs or not.
-the total pair variable keeps track of the pairs revealed.

5. endMatch()
-when 17 pairs are revealed the program checks the final cards if any remain.
-than the endMatch function announces the winner and prints the scores

Validations
1. isdigit and isupper checks the if the input coordinates are correct or not.
2. if else conditions are used to check if the coordinates are inside the board and if the pairs are already revealed or not.
